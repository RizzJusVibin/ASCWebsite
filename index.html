            <p>I have always had many hobbies. My most enjoyable hobby that I tend to do every day is to play videogames. I think that there is not only comfort in playing and relaxing, but there is also much to learn. Some things that I have learned while gaming is music composition, storytelling, character development, and most importantly I learned that I want to study in the technology industry. Another hobby I have is playing piano, as it is very calm and relaxing, and there is much to learn because you want to know how to play certain songs and music theory just to freestyle. I think it is very funny how people are impressed easily with piano playing, as it is not that hard to learn and is just a fun thing to do. A hobby I picked up in 2022 was skateboarding. I have a longboard, skateboard, and pennyboard, and they all have their own uses but are fun to learn. I can do tic tacs and shuvits. A hobby that I have but am not good at is drawing. I am not that great at it but it is always something to do in school during free time. The last hobby that I have is to play these sports: Rowing, Baseball, Volleyball, Tennis, Ping Pong, and Boxing. They all are competitive in one way or another and they are fun to play and learn.</p>

            <p>Over the course of my academic career, I have been to 2 different schools. The first school that I went to was Suder Montessori from pre-k through 8th grade. Because we were taught with Montessori work ethics, I was able to get a lot of hands on practice with different materials, was able to gain a good work ethic, and was able to have a welcoming community all around me. I am still very good friends with some people from there, and this is the school that I learned to play piano. The high school that I have been attending is Chicago Hope Academy. I have had a 4.0 GPA the last 2 years and it is due to the amazing community that the school has built. It is a Christian school, so a lot of the ideas are based around God, and there is nothing but good at this school.</p>

            <p>Since 1st grade, I have always been involved with sports. From 1st grade to present I have been in baseball, and what I enjoy from this sport is the teamwork that is needed in order to actually win games. I tried soccer in 2nd grade and hated it. My neighbor introduced my brother and I to tennis and ping pong in 6th grade, and they are not bad sports, just a little boring. I have been doing boxing since freshman year, and although you do get hurt, the best part about the sport is working out to prep for fights. I picked up volleyball and rowing Sophomore year and they are both fun, but volleyball can be frustrating with the wrong team.</p>

On my father's side, I have 6 uncles and 5 aunts and countless cousins. So yeah, I have a pretty big family.</p>

            <p>I have many goals for myself in the near future. I really want to graduate high school with a 4.0 GPA, I want to get into Northwestern University, and pass my future AP exams. These are my academic goals for the next 2 years, and I just have to keep working hard at them. Other goals I have are to become a Medical-bio technician, because all I want to do is help people. And I think 2 hobby goals are to go to the gym more and finish my games backlog.</p>
